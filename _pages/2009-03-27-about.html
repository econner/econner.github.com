I am also a section leader for the introductory computer science (CS106A/B/X) classes.  Two summers ago I helped build the initial iteration of <a href="https://courseware.stanford.edu/">courseware</a>, a course management system being used by a number of CS classes at Stanford.  Last summer I worked at <a href="http://katango.com">Katango</a> and this summer I worked on my own project with a few friends <a href="http://raunk.com/">Raunk</a>.

I am from Colorado and like to snowboard, hike, run, and workout.  I also really like electronic music and building random things with friends.  This has led to projects like <a href="http://notcokem.com/">The Not Coke Machine</a>, <a href="http://jitterbunk.com/>Jitterbunk</a>, <a href="http://paperless.stanford.edu/">Paperless</a>, <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/drawonyou">DrawOnYou</a>, the <a href="http://stanfordflipside.com/category/puzzles/">Flipside puzzles</a> page
